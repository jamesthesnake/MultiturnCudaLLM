In the development phase of a Kevin-32B-style project ‚Äî that is, while you're actively training the agent and tuning the environment ‚Äî the breakdown of 70% CPU / 30% GPU comes from the frequency and cost of each task. Here's the concrete breakdown:

üîß CPU-Dominant Tasks (~70%)
Task	% of Total Time	Why It‚Äôs CPU-Bound
CUDA Compilation (nvcc or nvrtc)	30‚Äì40%	Compilation is mostly handled by CPU. Even with parallel jobs, it‚Äôs the slowest step unless cached.
LLM Token Generation (CPU inference)	10‚Äì20%	If you're running a model like DeepSeek-Coder on CPU (or calling an API), decoding is CPU-heavy and slow.
Environment Orchestration (veRL, Gym)	~5%	Episodic logic, memory buffers, episode resets, reward logic ‚Äî all CPU-heavy Python ops.
Static Code Analysis	~2‚Äì5%	Counting lines, detecting shared memory/registers, etc. ‚Äî fast string parsing.
Unit Test Execution (on CPU tensors)	5‚Äì10%	For many tasks you validate against PyTorch on CPU unless you batch.
Logging, Caching, Hashing	~2%	File I/O, md5 checks to avoid recompilation, reward trace logging.
‚öôÔ∏è GPU-Dependent Tasks (~30%)
Task	% of Total Time	Why It Needs GPU
Candidate Kernel Execution	10‚Äì15%	To measure actual speedup over PyTorch, you run CUDA kernels on GPU. This is fast (ms), but adds up.
Baseline PyTorch Execution (GPU)	5‚Äì10%	Needed for fair comparison on same tensor shape.
LLM Inference (if using GPU)	10‚Äì15%	If you use vLLM, FlashAttention, or run a quantized 7B/13B on GPU, this offloads inference and saves time.
Reward Model / Discriminator (Optional)	<5%	Not essential, but some versions use a learned reward function or evaluator on GPU.
Example: One RL Step (CPU vs GPU Timeline)
Phase	Task	CPU Time	GPU Time
Step 1	Generate candidate CUDA	1.0s	0.0s
Step 2	Compile with nvcc	5.0s	0.0s
Step 3	Run unit test (CPU tensors)	0.5s	0.0s
Step 4	Run PyTorch op (baseline)	0.0s	0.1s
Step 5	Run candidate kernel	0.0s	0.1s
Step 6	Analyze and reward	0.5s	0.0s
üîÅ Multiply by 100K+ steps: most of your time is eaten up by nvcc and LLM decoding unless you optimize for reuse.
TL;DR
The development phase feels CPU-heavy because:

Compilation dominates
You're validating a lot of broken/unoptimized code
Many candidate generations fail correctness and never hit the GPU
Only a minority of steps reach the ‚Äúrun kernel and profile‚Äù phase
Want a version that does most of this offline or asynchronously to batch up GPU usage? That‚Äôs how Kevin-32B scaled.
